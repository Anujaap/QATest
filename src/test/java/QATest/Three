Advantages of TestNG annotations

1- TestNG identifies the methods it is interested in, by looking up annotations.
Hence, method names are not restricted to any pattern or format.
2- We can pass additional parameters to annotations.
3- Annotations are strongly typed, so the compiler will flag any mistakes right away.
4- Test classes no longer need to extend anything (such as TestCase, for JUnit 3).
